# Cutline-rust

_WIP_

Rust implementation of the "optimal SFA cutline and pattern finding" algorithm. This is a rewrite of the javascript version which is implemented by Youwei Zhao to gain a speed boost.

# TODO

- impl CLI
- check the correctness
- input/output format(use search pattern instead of cyclic circuit depth), check the bitpattern and output all the patterns with the same maximum cost
