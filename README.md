# Cutline-rust

_WIP_

Rust implementation of the "optimal SFA cutline and pattern finding" algorithm. This is a rewrite of the javascript version which is implemented by Youwei Zhao to gain a speed boost.

# TODO

- check the correctness
- refactor the code and try to improve the performance
- input/output format(use search pattern instead of cyclic circuit depth), check the bitpattern and output all the patterns with the same maximum cost
- impl CLI
- debug the 32 vs.64 cutlines problem under 20_0000 patterns
